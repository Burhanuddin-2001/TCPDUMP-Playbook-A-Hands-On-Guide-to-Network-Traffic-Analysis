# Code of Conduct:

Welcome to the TCPDUMP project! I believe that collaboration, attention to detail, and a learner-first approach are at the heart of building a truly valuable resource. To maintain this spirit, please follow the guidelines below when contributing:

## 1. **Include Analogies for Clarity and Consistency**

Each new contribution should come with an analogy that simplifies the concept and fits seamlessly into the style of this guide. Analogies act as bridges, making complex commands or configurations relatable and easier to grasp for readers and practitioners alike. Whether it's comparing packet capture to a security camera or likening flags in a TCP header to signposts on a highway, use analogies to maintain the guide’s approachable tone and help demystify challenging topics.

## 2. **Ensure Relevance and Quality — Avoid Redundancies**

Every piece of content here should offer a **new** perspective, insight, or application. If your addition covers the same ground as an existing section but does it with more clarity, depth, or real-world relevance, feel free to **replace** the old content. The aim is to **reduce noise** for our readers. This makes it easier for everyone to stay focused on what truly matters without re-reading repeated concepts.

**Guideline:** Before submitting, ask yourself: *Does this bring something unique or needed to the guide?* If yes, add it! If no, consider refining it or offering a fresh take on the topic. And if you are unsure, open a discussion or an issue so we can evaluate it together.

## 3. **Test, Verify, and Then Share — Accuracy is Key**

When contributing new commands, examples, or configurations, always **test them thoroughly** on your own machine to confirm they work as intended. TCPDUMP, like many command-line tools, can be sensitive to syntax changes or system variations, making accuracy critical. If you see an issue or a command that doesn’t work as described, kindly open an issue so we can address it. The goal is to ensure that this guide remains a **trusted** and **error-free** resource for everyone.

**Tip:** Copy-pasting from external sources is fine as long as you **verify** the content in your environment. If a particular command doesn’t work, share the updated command or suggest a workaround.

#### Thank you for helping to make this guide a trusted, learner-friendly resource!
